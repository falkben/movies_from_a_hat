The [prior project](https://github.com/MoviesFromAHat/MoviesFromAHat.github.io/) uses a static list of movies uploaded as data to it's GitHub repo, and generates a static site to choose movies from.

This project endeavors to be more dynamic, by utilizing a database to allow for users to:

- easily modify the movie list
- form user groups
- create custom sets of movies to choose from
- come up with their own rules for movie inclusion
