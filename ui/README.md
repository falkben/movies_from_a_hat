### ðŸŒˆ Elm Land

[Elm Land](https://elm.land/) is a framework for [Elm](https://elm-lang.org) that
simplifies writing single page apps in Elm by generating glue code for you.

### Tailwind CSS

[Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) is a CSS development framework based on 
utility classes. It generates CSS from the view source code, so we're guaranteed
never to have old, unused CSS hanging around
